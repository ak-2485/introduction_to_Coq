This repository contains materials for the Bindel group meeting on September 23, 2022 introducing the Coq proof assistant. 

We used a [web-based environment for Coq](https://coq.vercel.app/) developed by Emilio Jesús Gallego Arias (Inria, Université de Paris, IRIF), Shachar Itzhaky (Technion), and contributors.

The best resource for installing Coq on your personal machine is the [Coq platform](https://github.com/coq/platform). It has all of the libraries and packages you will need, and more. 

The web-based environment for Coq is too limited for real world use. I use the [CoqIDE](https://coq.inria.fr/refman/practical-tools/coqide.html). It's great. You can install it with Opam. See [Installing CoqIDE
.](https://coq.inria.fr/opam-using.html) You can also [use Coq in a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/EugeneLoy/coq_jupyter) alongside Python or Julia. 

Cornell's CS 3110 has a convenient [cheat sheet](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2018sp/a5/coq-tactics-cheatsheet.html) of basic Coq tactics.

[The Coq Reference Manual](https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/) is a great resource. You might consider looking at the documentation on [Basic Proof Writing](https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/refman/proofs/writing-proofs/index.html) from the manual.
